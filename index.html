        <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised
            as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says
            that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like
            they're actually proud of that shit.  </p>

        <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt
            with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on
            his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in
            it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store,
            because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb. </p>

        <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the
            tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the
            weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of
            lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those
            who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord
            when I lay My vengeance upon thee. </p>
