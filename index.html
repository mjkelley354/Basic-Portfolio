        <p>The picture here looks very serious but I'm actually a friendly guy.  I'm at coding boot
            camp because I want to learn coding.  I know some vb, Java and SQL but there's a lot I
            don't know too.  I work in a software development environment already but I'm not a
            developer.  I've been a Technical Product Owner for a couple of years now and I direct
            my teams to build a product but there's a lot about what they do that I just don't
            understand..  </p>

        <p>So I'm here to get a better understanding of what it takes to make the software products
            we sell.  Also because my teams are actually offshore resources that aren't directly
            employed by my company, I don't always feel that I can hold the engineers accountable.
            I really just have to go with what they say.</p>

        <p>More recently, I've changed roles at work again.  I'm now working in Product Management for
            the same application and software solutions.  This gets me even further from the coding
            effort but I still want to know how it works.  What that knowledge will get me will, I
            hope help to ensure we build a better product and I'm hoping to be as involved in that
            as my employer will allow.</p>
